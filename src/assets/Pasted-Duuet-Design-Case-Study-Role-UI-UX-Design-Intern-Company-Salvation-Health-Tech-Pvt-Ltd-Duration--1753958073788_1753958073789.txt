Duuet — Design Case Study
Role: UI/UX Design Intern
Company: Salvation Health Tech Pvt Ltd
Duration: Jan 2025 – Present
Team: Myself + Developers
Status: Live | 2000+ users

About the Project
Duuet is a skincare and haircare app built for Gen Z. It helps users discover products, understand ingredient transparency, and engage with real, relatable beauty conversations—without filters or fluff.

I joined the team as the first design intern and helped bring the product to life—working from early concepts to a live app now used by over 2,000 people.

My Role
I designed the entire app experience from scratch, including:

Building key user flows from zero

Designing every screen in Figma

Iterating based on real user feedback

Collaborating closely with developers throughout the build

My Design Process
1. Understanding the Problem
Spent time reviewing how Gen Z talks about skincare—on Reddit, YouTube, and in internal user chats. The pattern was clear: they don’t trust polished marketing. They want honest product insights, real opinions, and a space that feels familiar.

2. Mapping Key Features
I designed flows and UI for:

Home screen: Simple, scrollable, with smart entry points

Buzz: A space for short skincare/haircare videos and posts

Shop: Team-buy model with wholesale pricing

Product Pages: AI-based insights like hazard score and efficacy

Scan Feature: Users can scan product labels to get ingredient info

Plus: Search, onboarding, profile, and empty states

3. Visual & Interaction Design
Kept the interface light, familiar, and Gen Z-friendly. Used Duuet’s core brand colors, rounded cards, and subtle gradients. Built reusable components to keep things scalable.

4. Feedback & Iteration
As real users started joining, I made design updates based on what worked and what didn’t—small UI tweaks, improved flow clarity, better spacing, etc.

Outcome
The app crossed 2000+ users organically. My designs were handed off, implemented, and are actively used today. It’s still evolving, but I continue to support the team with updated designs and new features.

What I Learned
This was my first experience designing a full product end-to-end. I learned how to break down features, communicate with developers, and adjust quickly based on feedback—all while designing for an audience that doesn’t tolerate anything that feels fake or complicated.
