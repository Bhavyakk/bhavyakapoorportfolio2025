You already have a 5‑section portfolio live here. Update **only** the styling and animations as follows:

1. **Global**  
   - Switch to a geometric sans (e.g. Manrope).  
   - Headings ultra‑bold, body text regular (16px desktop / 14px mobile).  
   - Base colors: #000 / #FFF + gradient accent #6F61EF→#39D2C0.  
   - Tiny drifting particles on dark sections; faint light radial gradient on white sections.  
   - Scroll‑triggered fade‑up + slide animations on every block.

2. **Navbar**  
   - Wrap your existing nav links in an 80px‑high pill‑shaped semi‑opaque bar.  
   - Left: logo; right: “Download CV” (gradient border) & “Get Started” (filled gradient).

3. **Section 1 – Hero (dark)**  
   - Full‑viewport. Title “BHAVYA KAPOOR” (120px, white glow gradient outline).  
   - Subheading 24px white.  
   - Buttons: “Launch Projects” (filled dark + teal glow) & “Download CV” (white outline + purple glow).  
   - On load: fade text up + pulse button glows.

   - Two dark cards side‑by‑side (“Who I Am” + “My Mission”), rounded corners, drop shadow.  
   - Right: portrait frame + two floating skill badges (“Figma”, “Adobe XD”) that slide & fade in on scroll.

5. **Section 3 – Expertise & Projects (white)**  
   - Expertise: six cards with gradient progress bars.  
   - Projects: on hover, each card’s border glows in the accent gradient.

6. **Section 4 – Interactive Demo (dark)**  
   - Left: draggable “Document” card with two colored cursors and inline formatting toolbar (Bold, Italic, Underline, Link).
